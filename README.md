Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The objective of this Course Project is my ability to use R to collect, work with and clean a data set.

The provided CodeBook.md Markdown file is used to create documentation detailing the steps used to produce the Tidy Data Set.

The run_analsis.R is the R code used to collect and tranform the raw data into a Tidy Data Set.
