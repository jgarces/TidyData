##Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The objective of this Course Project is my ability to use R to collect, work with and clean a data set.

## Introduction

The run_analsis.R script found in this Repo is used to download and cache data from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> and tranform the raw data into a Tidy Data Set.

## Script use

To use the script download the run_analsis.R to a working directory. The script will create to sub directories
1. sourceData - This directory will download and cache the raw data from the above source.
2. tidyData - This directory will contain the resulting tidy data set output file

## CodeBook

The provided CodeBook.md Markdown file is used to create documentation detailing the steps used to produce the Tidy Data Set.
